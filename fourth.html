              The domestic dog is an extremely social animal and offers a
              diverse variety of choices as there are well over 300 breeds
              recognized by the World Canine Organization. Adopting a dog offers
              mutual benefits between dog and owner. Many studies cite the
              social benefits of having a companion as well as the reduced
              feelings of loneliness from adopting a dog. Studies even show
              medical indicators such as reduced blood pressure and improved
              lipid profiles

              Throughout dogs’ lifespans, they should generally be fed fewer
              meals as they mature. Puppies should be nursed the first two
              months, then introduced to three meals per day when they are about
              three to six months years old. Their food intake should be reduced
              to two meals per day when they are six months to one year old and
              finally reduced to one meal after they reach one year old. A dog’s
              typical body mass is composed of somewhere between 60 and 70
              percent water.The ASPCA says just a 10 percent decrease in body
              water can cause illness, and a 15 percent loss can cause death, so
              make sure you keep your pooch hydrated!

              Much like humans, dogs need to have a healthy level of activity to
              keep their organs healthy, as well as sun and fresh air. The
              minimum recommended time for exercise varies greatly with breed
              and size differences, but generally a range of 30–120 minutes of
              exercise is recommended per day!Can you imagine exercising two
              hours per day? OK, I know that wouldn't bother some of you reading
              this. But the thought of it to me makes me cringe! And by the way,
              exercising your dog does not mean you are being challenged to a
              push-up contest.
            </p>

              Brisk walks are OK too! You can also choose from a variety of toys
              to encourage physical activity; just be sure they are age
              appropriate and do not pose a choking hazard. Pay careful
              attention to toys that require supervision.

              Keeping your furry family member clean is important to its health.
              So be sure to brush frequently to reduce the amount of shedding
              and prevent matted and tangled fur that can prove to be extremely
              difficult to remove. Check for insects such as ticks and fleas,
              especially after visiting heavily wooded areas.
            </p>

              Bathing is not only important to your dog’s health but can be an
              exercise depending on how strong willed the dog is. Rinse all of
              the soap out, as any residual soap can result in a rash. Be sure
              the soap is formulated for your puppy or dog, since harsh soaps
              can cause allergic reactions. And as always, be careful how you
              handle your loved one.
            </p>

              No matter the size of your dog, you need to be cautious as you
              carry your canine. If you have a small dog, then cradle the pup
              with one hand under the chest and the forearm supporting the back
              half. If it is a large dog, reach under the belly with both your
              arms perpendicular to the dog, and use each arm to support the
              chest and rear as you lift.

              You should always consult with your veterinarian, but there is a
              core set of vaccines that are typically recommended. Vaccines that
              reduce the exposure risk to things such as hepatitis, rabies, and
              parvovirus. Others may be determined by your vet depending on the
              environment in which the dog resides. Some of these include
              Bordetella bronchiseptica, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Leptospira
              bacteria.

              Much like many living organisms, the body begins to deteriorate
              and experience a lot of changes. Cats at this age should eat less
              fats and calories and more quality proteins.
            </p>

              This means when you are purchasing packaged foods for your cat,
              look for food that states a particular protein (such as "salmon")
              and not just a category (such as fish). This usually means they
              are byproducts, or combinations, of lesser quality proteins.
